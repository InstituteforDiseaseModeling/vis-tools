==========
Quickstart
==========

This section provides two quick introductions to |VT|, one running |VT| from
within the |COMPS_s| system, the other running standalone and doing a
visualization of an existing set of sample data that is included in the |VT|
distribution. The latter quick start also contains an abbreviated treatment of
the preprocessing of simulation data.

Be sure to review the :doc:`prereqs` before proceeding.
