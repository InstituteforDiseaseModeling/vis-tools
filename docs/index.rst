=======================
Welcome to |IDM_s| |VT|
=======================

The |IDM_l| develops complex software for disease modeling. The primary
software, |EMOD_l|, helps determine the combination of health policies and
intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. The effective use
of |EMOD_s| requires analysis of simulation output. |VT| is a collection of
software tools that aids in the visualization of geospatial simulation data.
